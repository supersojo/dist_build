# prepare stuff for gcc

gcc needs some libraries for build process.

- GMP
  GMP is the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library

- MPFR
  MPFR is the GNU Multiple-precision floating-point rounding library

- MPC
  MPC is the GNU Multiple-precision C library. It depends on GMP and MPFR

- ELF
  ELF stands for Executable and Linkable Format. This library provides architecture-independent size and endian support

- GCC
  GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection

To compile gcc we need c library and the header files(It's not the truth. We can build a first stage gcc(bootstrap gcc) without headers then use the
first stage gcc to compile the glibc(only bootstrap or headers). So First we build libc with existed gcc, then using the built libc to
built our gcc.

To compile libc we need kernel headers. So first we build kernel with existed gcc, then we get kernel headers ot be used for libc.
